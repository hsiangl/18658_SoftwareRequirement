1. Feeling bring a firefighter

2. most challenge

	management, maintain

		continue edunation year round, different skills, recertification

	doing job: easy, fun

	other stuff: it's a drag

3. How often calls

	13 calls

	sometimes 0 for

	aircraft, fire, medical(majority: 85%)

4. Government

	Funding: not sufficient

	change year to year

	Depends on:

	Old truck: 1971, however, regulation require renew

5. Fire Equipment

	communication: radio

	glove sticks many things

	hose line: cant talking at the same time (radio in the pocket)

	right channel of frequency: different enery scene

	in and out: different channel

	Concern: gadget-> get hit, get bumped

	Suggestion: different buttons

	Smoke: limited visibility -> may not see the screen

		can hear, engine, debris -> dirty things

		alert: sound, horn, radio

	Concrete basement: low reception, loss connection (dead zone)

		yell, relay message

		map: show where am I(GPS), elevation (floor), look for the hose;

	vibration? has to be very strong

	Bulky fire fighter suit

	Fire scene retreat: use hose

6. Dangerrous

	Medical issue is the most dangerous

	Somebody wants to hurt you (People more dangerous than fire)

	Has to engage

7. How noisy

	Hose stream, cracking wood, unique hearing protection

	Sound of rockets

	Fire alarm

	Single event: commander

	Multiple event: 13 in one channel, 1-2 commander

8. Most important info when 

	House, victim? decide when to out

	There are few teams: eg see collapse, get on radio: this building is gonna collapse to commander, vacate

	Cool: my whole team is intact

	Command: accountability for every team member

	PAR: how many teammates

	"Less people talk on the radio is better"

	People get in and out in the PAR

	"OK button" vs "Not OK"

	Team: captain, engine guy, fight fire*3

	Command talk to captain

	"Less in more"

	Device:

		"get out" "man down" "help" "Too hot"-> utilize color (green, red, yellow)

		Make "PAR" easy: get rid of radio

		Sleeve better be water-proof

	Cost:

		Communication is a huge amount of money

		Set of cell phone: department policy, department pay for it

		whole sleeve thing

		Sell to the department: has to be every body

	Pervasice, usefulness, safety

	Airpack: send data back to commander

	Icon: used up air, how long in the fire scene

	Map: where the alarm is

	Integration of technology

	Air monitor: button, scroll

		Level O2, CO2 -> tells the building safe or not

		Big button
